Hello, I am Revathi, Welcome to my page.

## What is Growth Mindset

According to me Growth mindset seek out challenges and view failure as a chance to learn and build upon their abilities. With time and effort, their intelligence and knowledge can grow because they recognise that their effort influence success, so they spent more time practicing or learning, which leads to higher levels of achievement.

### I want to stay in Growth Mindset by doing the following:	

- Its never too late to learn.
- It's okay if I fail, atleast I learned something.
- I can improve at soomething if I try.
- What can I do better next time to make this work?
- As long as I have determination, I can do anything.
