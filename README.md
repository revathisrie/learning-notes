Hello, I am Revathi, Welcome to my page. My [Github Portfolio page](https://github.com/revathisrie). 

This page includes few of my thoughts and learnings on Growth Mindset.

### Growth Mindset

According to me Growth mindset seek out challenges and *__view failure as a chance to learn and build upon their abilities__*. With time and effort, their intelligence and knowledge can grow because they recognise that their effort influence success, so they spent more time practicing or learning, which leads to higher levels of achievement.

### 3 reminders to myself:	

1. It's **never too late to learn**.
2. It's **okay if I fail**, atleast I learned something.
3. As long as I have __determination, I can do anything__.
