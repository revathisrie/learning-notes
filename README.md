Hello, I am Revathi, Welcome to my page.

## What is Growth Mindset

According to me Growth mindset seek out challenges and view failure as a chance to learn and build upon their abilities. With time and effort, their intelligence and knowledge can grow because they recognise that their effort influence success, so they spent more time practicing or learning, which leads to higher levels of achievement.

### The following are the 3 remainders that keep myself in Growth Mindset:	

- It's **never too late to learn**.
- It's **okay if I fail**, atleast I learned something.
- As long as I have __determination, I can do anything__.
