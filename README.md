## What is Growth Mindset

Growth mindset seek out challenges and view failure as a chance to learn and build upon their abilities. With time and effort, their intelligence and knowledge can grow because they recognise that their effort influence success, so they spent more time practicing or learning, which leads to higher levels of achievement.

### Fixed vs. Growth Mindset

In fixed mindset, intelligent and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points.
