## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:
 * Gists
 * Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
 * Files with the .md or .markdown extension
