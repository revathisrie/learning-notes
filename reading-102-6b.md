## How Computers Work
* Take Input
* Store Information
* Process
* Output the Results

## Binary & Data:
* Computers work on 1's and 0's.
* An Electric wire can be ON or OFF, or anything else with only 2 options. This On & OFF on a single wire is called a BIT. It is smallest piece of information a computer can store.
* With more BITS you can represent more complex Information.
* The Binary Number System is represented with 0 or 1.
* Text, Images, Sound can also be represented with 0 or 1.

## Circuit and Logic:
* Complicated Circuits take Multiple signals & combine them to give different results. 
* The smaller the circuit is, the less distance the electric signal has to go. Electricity moves at just about the speed of light, that is why modern circuits can perform Billions of calculations per second.

## Hadware & Software:
* CPU: It is the master chip that controls all other parts of the computer. It receives simple commands that tell it which circuit to use and stores it in the memory.
* The Binary command stored in Memory, the CPU fetches and executes them in sequence.
* **Operating System**: The Master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer.
