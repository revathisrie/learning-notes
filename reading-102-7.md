## Intro + Scripts: Pages 1 - 24
## Expressions + Operators: 74 - 79
## Functions: 88 - 94

A Script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal
* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
* To write a Script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
  * Define the Goal
  * Design the Script
  * Code each step

## Expressions:
It evaluates results in a single value.
* Ex: var color = 'beige';
    * var area = 3*2;

## Operators:
 * Assignment Operators
 * Arithmetic Operators 
     * +,-,*,/,%,++,--.
 * String Operators
 * Comparision Operators
     * ==,!=,>,<,>,>=,<=,?.
 * Logical Operators:
     * &&,||,|

## Functions:
* It is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
* Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
* Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
* Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

### Why Functions: 
* You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
* You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.

## Outputting the Data:
* console.log(): Mainly used for debugging, write output on the browser console
* prompt(): Prompt for user input using dialog box
* document.write(): Write output to the html document
