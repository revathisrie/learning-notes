# Read: 06a - Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

## Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery, Pages 43 - 69.

JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.

- **JavaScript is Case Sensitive.**

## Variables:
   * var
   * let
   * const

## Including Comments
Comments are important because they help other people understand what is going on in your code or remind you if you forgot something yourself. Keep in mind that they have to be marked properly so the browser won’t try to execute them.

In JavaScript you have two different options:

Single-line comments — To include a comment that is limited to a single line, precede it with //
Multi-line comments — In case you want to write longer comments between several lines, wrap it in /* and */ to avoid it from being executed

## Data Types:
Variables can contain different types of values and data types. You use = to assign them:

Numbers — var age = 23
Variables — var x
Text (strings) — var a = "init"
Operations — var b = 1 + 2 + 3
True or false statements — var c = true
Constant numbers — const PI = 3.14
Objects — var name = {firstName:"Revathi", lastName:"Mylavarapu"}

## Objects
Objects are certain kinds of variables. They are variables that can have their own values and methods. The latter are actions that you can perform on objects.
  * Ex: var person = {
            firstName:"Revathi",
            lastName:"Mylavarapu",
            age:26,
            place:"Bellevue"
          };
